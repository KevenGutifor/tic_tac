# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking a space with "X" or "O".

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player X always goes first.
- Players alternate turns, marking an empty cell with their symbol (X or O).
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
